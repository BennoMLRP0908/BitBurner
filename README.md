This game is kinda interesting, it teaches u the fundamentals of javascript to some sort of degree.
It's not a fully in-depth editor like visual studio code but it's an RPG continious game.

It's not for everybody but it's fun to mess around on and make scripts. So here's what I spent like less than an hour on doing.
Making this repo. Making the scripts and setting up the commands to automate everything.

This repo can be used for more in-depth research and automation when it comes to this game.

I hope I see the SneakyHub development community submit some pull requests and help grow this repo!
I would love to see the community interact with a project like this. Just for fun :p 


# Clone ing (cant spell) lol

!!! WARNING !!!
You need to Modify the config of Cloner.js, don't edit anything unless you know what your doing.
Everything is self explanatory to an extent, CopyToAllServers should always be true and the
ScriptName is the name of the script to clone, RunInstantly means that it'll run it whenever it gets
restarted. AmountOfClones, the amount of clones to make.

!!! IT HAS TO BE RAN ON THE HOME SERVER !!!

File Name: Cloner.js

Run Command: ```run Cloner.js```

# Run scripts

!!! WARNING !!!
You will notice not all the scripts will run due to the memory of the victim not being able to hold all of these scripts.
